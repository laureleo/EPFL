## Somatosensory Systems and Brain Processing
### 4 Nerves
### 4 Brodmann areas
Primary somatosensory cortex consists of four Brodmann areas
* Area 3a: Proprioceptive
* Area 3b: Tactile, small receptive fields.
* Area 1: Tactile, large receptive fields
* Area 2: Tactile, proprioceptive
### Fingertip to brain. 
How is the touch sensation conveyed in the human body?
1. Skin
2. Periphere nerve
3. Spinal cord
4. Brain stem
5. Thalamus
6. Primary somatosensory cortex
### Hierarchial and paralell organization of the brain
Each Brodmann area is ordered in a hierarchical fashion with increasingly complex sensory managament from 3a, 3b, 1, to 2.

Each mapping from one part of the body to the somatosensory cortex lie in paralell through the four areas.
### Definitions
**Receptive field** The region of sensory space that will activate a neuron
**Somatopy** The point-to-point correspondence of an area of the body to an area of the CNS. Typically a point of the somatosensory cortex _see homonculus_
## Phantom Limbs, Amputation and Neuroscience.
### What is a phantom limb?
A limb you perceive the existence of, even without the corresponding body part.

### What is reffered touch.
When stimulation of one area of the body leads to the perception of stimulation of another area

### What causes a phantom limb?
PNS: There could be pathological connections between nerves, or the nerves that formerly lead to the limb could be activated.

CNS: When a limb is lost there is reorgnization in somatosensory cortex. Nearby areas might start to take over the area responsible for the lost limb, leading to reffered sensation

### Peripheral and central representation
### Exam question, reason for both PNS and CNS

## Exercise 1
### Somatosensory system
1. Somatosensory pathway
11. Describe how a tactile stimulus applied to the index finger travels to the brain
* like that
12. How many neurons are involved?
13. Where do the fibres cross the midline?

2. Somatosensory information is processed in S1, which is composed of 4 Brodmann areas
21. Name the 4 Brodmann areas in S1 involved in somatosensory processing
22. Describe which type of information (tactile, proprioceptive, etc.) is processed in each region
23. Explain how tactile receptive fields vary (size, type of stimulation) between each region

3. Describe two-point discrimination task (2PD).

4. Describe hierarchical and parallel organization of somatosensory system representation in the human brain.

### Limb amputations, phantom sensations, reorganisation

1. What is phantom pain and to which area of the brain is it related?
2. Define what is referred touch sensations and give an example .
3. Explain the concept of somatotopic mapping.
4. Which modifications take place in the cortex after amputation?
5. Describe one method that allows to lower phantom limb pain.

### Retargeted muscle and skin reinnervation

1. As an example of a reinnervation surgery, peripheral motor and somatosensory nerves (formerly connected to the hand) are now targeted to chest muscles (motor
fibres) and chest skin (somatosensory fibres), explain the gradual changes and the time scale that it takes for motor system and the sensory system to reconnect?
2. How does the hand representation in S1 change after the targetedsensory reinnervation?
3. What is the strategy to control prosthetic arm using the targeted reinnervation?

### Journal Club (Sensory capacity of reinnervated skin after redirection of amputated upper limb nerves to chest)
1. Explain what is targeted muscle and sensory re-innervation. Name 2 arm nerves that have been used in the re-innervation procedure and explain why.

2. What are the major issues for the artificial limbs ?

### Journal Club (Beyond re-membering: Phantom sensations of congenitally absent limbs)
1. What was the main view of phantom limbs in previous studies and what is the main finding of this article?

2. What was one candidate mediator of aplasic phantom sensations (phantom sensations of congenital absent limbs)?
