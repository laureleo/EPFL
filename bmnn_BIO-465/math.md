Because I will never stop being lacking when it comes to math.
# Differential equations
## Basic concepts
### Definitions
Differential equation
> Any equation which contains any kind of derivatives. As a familiar example newtons second law of motion F=ma, since a = dv/dt = d2s/dt2
Order of a differential equation
> The highest derivative present in the equation
Ordinary differential equation (ODE)
> A differential equation without partial derivatives, there is only one independent variable.
Partial differential equation (PDE)
> A differential equation with partial derivatives, there are more than one independent variable.
Linear differential equation
> The sum of derivatives of a function. No term is multiplied with any other term (it is a linear sum), no term occurs to any power other than one (all the terms are linear). The coefficients for each term are allowed to be both non-linear and arbritrary values, the import thing is that the differentiated function remains linear.

> It is all differential equations that can be written on the form: **g(x) = f(x)a0 + f'(x)a1 + f''(x)a2 +... f''...'an**
